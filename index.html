                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">CASIGURAN, Sorsogon – The Philippines is expected to experience at least two to five tropical cyclones in the first half of 2024, according to the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).</p>

                <p>Although there are no reported typhoons entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) in the first quarter of 2024, it is still highly anticipated that two to five tropical cyclones will occur before the end of June.</p>

                <p>Typhoons are characterised with strong winds and heavy rainfall, which may cause floods, loss of lives, displacement, casualties, disruption of the economy and environment. It is reported by PAGASA that the country experiences an average of 20 typhoons annually, five of which are destructive.</p>

                <p>The eastern regions of the country, particularly Bicol and Eastern Visayas, are the most vulnerable to tropical cyclones. In 2020, the Bicol region suffered four catastrophic typhoons, and two of them created massive destruction to the lives of those residing in the said places. These typhoons are named Rolly (international name Goni) and Ulysses (international name Vamco), which hit the region 10 days apart respectively. The disaster left several deaths and casualties across eight regions and damaged houses, commercial buildings, and other various properties.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, the super typhoon Yolanda (international name Haiyan) brought havoc and disturbance to the whole nation back in 2013 to 2014. The Visayas region, particularly the Eastern Visayas region, was the most affected area.The damage was so severe that it resulted in approximately 13 billion USD, according to World Vision. It took years for the affected areas to recover some losses, however it was not the same for most Filipinos anymore. As per the Asia Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC), the typhoon Yolanda roughly induced over 6,000 deaths, 28,000 injuries, 1,000 missing persons, and affected 16 million Filipinos.</p>

                <p>The Philippines is located in the Pacific Ocean and is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, making it susceptible to hazards and disasters. Filipinos are commonly exposed to natural hazards, such as seismic and volcanic hazards for areas near fault lines and volcanoes, as well as typhoon hazards.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 4em;">MORONG, Bataan – The Bataan Nuclear Power Plant began its construction in 1976, under the regime of former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., as Asia's first venture into nuclear energy.
                </p>

                <p>Joining the global effort to transition towards sustainable energy and mitigate the skyrocketing energy prices, President Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. announced interest in revisiting nuclear energy and reviving the unused Bataan Nuclear Plant, a $2.3 billion project initiated by his father.
                </p>

                <p>Being located only 100 kilometers from Manila, the country's capital, it became the center of attention for protests in the late 1970s to 1980s deeming its construction a hazard to public health and safety. The plant's location was criticized for being in an earthquake-prone zone and proximity to Mount Natib, with several earthquakes occurring on the Caldera volcano from 1951 to 2016 based on data from the US Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center. Furthermore, opposition to the nuclear plant also arose with concerns regarding the reliance on imported uranium and the possible threat of a nuclear meltdown.
                </p>

                <p>Due to the numerous hazards and public backlash, the construction of the Philippines' only attempt to build a nuclear power plant was mothballed following the 1986 nuclear disaster in Chornobyl, Ukraine. 
                </p>

                <p>In late 2023, the Department of Energy announced that it is considering entering into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co., Ltd. (KHNP) in conducting a feasibility study on the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, an analysis aiming to find out the possibility of reviving the Philippine's mothballed nuclear plant.

                <p style="text-indent: 5vw;">GAZA CITY, Palestine – The ongoing military tensions between Palestine and Israel has affected the lives of over 100,000 civilians within the city. The daily "massacres" continue, killing thousands from both sides of the conflict.</p>

                <p>Based on data from WHO, OCHA, and Government Media Office in Gaza, 85% or 1.7 million of the total population of the city are internally displaced, living in refugee camps; 47% of which are children; and over 360,000 residential units have been destroyed or damaged.</p>

                <p>In March 18, 2024, the Israeli army allowed the entry of 9 trucks carrying humanitarian aid into Jabalia, Gaza's northern city, for the first time in several months.</p>
                
                <p>Israel has been accussed by Oxfam for intentionally blocking the supply of humanitarian aid into Gaza. According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, at least 27 individuals have died of malnutrition and dehydration as a result of the blockade.</p>

                <p>Israel Katz, the Israeli foreign minister, responded to the accusations that "Israel allows extensive humanitarian aid into Gaza by land, air, and sea for anyone willing to help.", and blamed Hamas for hindering aid.</p>
